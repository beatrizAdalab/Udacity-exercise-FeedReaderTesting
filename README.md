# JavaScript Testing

Practice testing your javascript applications using Jasmine!

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

`git clone https://github.com/udacity/ud549` and open the files in your editor to follow along with [Udacity's JavaScript Testing course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-testing--ud549).
